# TODOs:
- [x] Figure a way to handle and report errors
- [ ] Write a set of tests
- [ ] Add support for types on variable declarations
- [ ] Rename some tokens to improve code readability
- [ ] Look for better ways to design your CLI interface c:
- [x] Think about storing information about places on the tokens (probaby coming up with a token type c:)
